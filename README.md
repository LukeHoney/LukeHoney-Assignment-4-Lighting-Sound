##  Features:
### :rose: Interactable Roses

There are 4 Roses available for the user to pick up from the marble table. The user can pick up the rose and if they think the singer is doing a good job the user can throw the rose to the singer this will begin a few events, first the crowd will cheer each NPC has an individual foley sound cheering for the singer and each rose will trigger a different foley sound. Another event that gets triggered is a particle effect with rose petals floating in the area.

### :iphone: Interactable Phone
Alongside the roses is a mobile phone. To make the phone look more realistic the emission section of the materials was used to make the screen glow. The mobile phone has 2 lights on it, a Realtime spotlight that the user can use as a touch to light up the scene. This touch is quite a lot stronger than the rest of the ones in the scene. The other light is a point light this is to make the touch look like it is on to the user. Once the user is holding the phone after 5 seconds the user will receive a phone call, making the phone start an audio buzz just like a real phone. The audio reverb zone is done in such a way that the user can hear how close the phone is to them and then throw the phone to stop how loud it is. The user can also throw the phone towards the stage which will make the crowd cheer almost to say well done for not answering the call, the spotlight will change to purple, and a dry ice smoke particle effect will display.
